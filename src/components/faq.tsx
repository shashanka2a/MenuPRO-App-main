  {
    question: "How does MenuPRO work?",
    answer: "Customers scan a QR code at their table using their smartphone, browse your digital menu, and place orders directly. No need for waiters to take orders - customers order what they want, when they want it."
  },
  {
    question: "What are the benefits for customers?",
    answer: "Customers can add allergy information, special dietary requirements, and specific cooking instructions that waiters might forget. They can also see detailed menu descriptions, photos, and customize their orders exactly how they want them."
  },
  {
    question: "How do customers pay?",
    answer: "Customers pay directly through the app when they check out. Payment processing is coming soon - for now, customers can place orders and pay at the table or counter as usual."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need any special equipment?",
    answer: "No special equipment needed! Customers use their own smartphones to scan QR codes and place orders. You just need a device to manage orders (tablet, phone, or computer)."
  },
  {
    question: "What if customers don't have smartphones?",
    answer: "We provide backup options including printed menus with QR codes and staff-assisted ordering. Our system works on any device with a camera and internet connection."
  },
  {
    question: "When will MenuPRO be available?",
    answer: "MenuPRO is launching soon! We're currently in development and will be available for restaurants to start using in the coming months. Sign up to be notified when we launch."
